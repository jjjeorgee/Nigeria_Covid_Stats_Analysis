#### Abstract
   This is a project utilizing SQL to perform an exploratory analysis of COVID-19 data 
from the month of February 2020 to the month of March 2022, specifically from Nigeria.
This data is taken from multiple sources chief of which is [OurworldinData.org](https://ourworldindata.org/).
Key metrics have been noted from the available data, and a Tableau dashboard containing visualizations of these metrics can be found [Here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oladimeji.olaniyan/viz/NigeriaCOVID-19Data/Dashboard1).  
The SQL code utilized in performing the exploration can be viewed in this [repository](https://github.com/jjjeorgee/Nigeria_Covid_Stats_Analysis/blob/main/Nigeria%20COVID%20data(SQL%20Data%20Exploration%20Project).sql)

#### Objectives
This analysis is aimed at exploring a few key metrics.

- The infection rate in each state collated with each state's total population.

- The death rate on each state collated with each states infected population.

- The national infection rate collated with the national death rate.

- Vaccinated population of each state if the country.

#### Data wrangling 
Before getting to these objectives, the data provided must first be cleaned and organized.
This was primarily done using SQL. 
The dataset initially included a lot of redundant or unwanted columns,
and so with the aid of SQL, I was able to retrieve only the data needed for the analysis.

```
SELECT CDN.date, CDN.new_cases, CDN.total_cases, CDN.new_deaths, CDN.total_deaths, CDN.population,
	   EDI.region, EDI.infected, EDI.deaths, EDI.cured,
			CVN.new_vaccinations,
				EVI.total_vaccinated_population 
					FROM covid_deaths_Nigeria AS CDN
						JOIN extra_death_info AS EDI
					ON CDN.date = EDI.date 
				JOIN covid_vaccinations_nigeria AS CVN
			ON CDN.date = CVN.date
		JOIN extra_vaccination_info AS EVI
    ON EDI.region = EVI.region
ORDER BY 1;

```

>The code above shows how I was able to do this with *SQL Joins* and *Embedded queries*

#### Exploratory data analysis
There were alot of interesting metrics to be extracted from the available datasets, but my analysis was focused certain onjectives. 

#### Visualization 
 This was done using tableau to create a dashboard of some key metrics.
This dashboard is available here on [Tableaupublic.com](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oladimeji.olaniyan/viz/NigeriaCOVID-19Data/Dashboard1)
